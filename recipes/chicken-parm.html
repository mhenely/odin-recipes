        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <h4>Sauce</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a saute pan, saute ¼ chopped onion for 3 minutes before adding a couple of cloves of garlic and saute for 30 seconds before adding 2-3 tablespoons of tomato paste and a shake of red chili flakes. Saute for 1 minute.</li>
                    <li>Add in a 28oz can of whole San Marzano tomatoes stir in and crush the tomatoes up and place over medium heat. Bring up to a simmer then lowering the heat to maintain a bare bubble. </li>
                    <li>Add in a shake of dried oregano, couple of stems of fresh basil, and 1 cup of tap water. Stir to combine and let simmer for 45 minutes. </li>
                    <li>Taste for seasoning adding in kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper as needed. Fish out any basil stems and set aside keeping warm until ready to serve.  </li>
                </ol>
            <h4>Chicken</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>On a plastic wrap surface, butterfly 4 large chicken breasts. Lay another plastic wrap over the chicken and pound the breasts out.</li>
                    <li>Salt and pepper before setting aside on a baking sheet while preparing the breading station. </li>
                    <li>For breading, crack 4 eggs along with a sprinkle of all-purpose flour in one bowl (beat together), all-purpose flour with freshly ground black pepper and a sprinkle of garlic powder, dried oregano, and dried basil whisked together in another bowl (½ tsp each per cup of flour), and spread panko bread crumbs on a rimmed baking sheet with a sprinkle of pre-grated parmesan cheese.</li>
                    <li>Using the “dry hand, wet hand” method, dip the chicken breasts into the flour then egg before covering every inch with panko breadcrumbs. For extra crispy, dip the chicken back into the egg and then back into the breadcrumbs. </li>
                    <li>Set the breadcrumbs coated chicken aside until ready to fry.</li>
                    <li>Heat a quart of peanut oil to 350°F, drop in the chicken and fry for roughly 5 minutes or deeply golden brown. Drain on paper towels once finished.</li>
                    <li>Place the chicken onto a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet and top with fresh basil, slices of fresh mozzarella, and freshly grated parmesan cheese. Place in the broiler for just a few minutes until the cheese is melted and slightly golden brown.</li>
